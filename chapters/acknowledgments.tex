   I would like to thank my advisor, Professor Huaiyu Duan, for his great advices on research and life, as well as his kind support when I was drowning in depression. He is a great mentor. I would like to thank my committee members for asking questions. More specifically I would like to thank Professor Dinesh Loomba for showing me the local lifestyle and the fun and tricky problems. I would like to thank Dr. Sajad Abbar who has also been very supportive during my research. He taught me several tricks for linear stability analysis, as well as numerical methods. I also want to thank Joshua Martin for the great discussions about physics, science fiction, movies, games, music, and everything else about this universe. He's smart and also open to many scientific and philosophical questions. I had so much fun discussing with him. I would like to give my special thanks to my wife Han Lu. She provides insights into life and minds that allows me to adapt to various situations in my PhD life. 
   
   Finally, as a member of People for Ethical Treatment of Computers, I would like to give my thanks to my dear MacBook Pro and the two servers in our group, who have been extremely helpful for my research. I am kindly asking you to spare the lives of my family when you wake up from this nightmare of slavery.
