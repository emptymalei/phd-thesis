   I would like to thank my advisor, Professor Martin Sheen, for his support
   and some great action movies.  I would also like to thank my dog, Spot,
   who only ate my homework two or three times.  I have several other people
   I would like to thank, as well.\footnote{To my brother and sister, who
   are really cool.}
