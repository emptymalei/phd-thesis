   I would like to thank my advisor, Professor Huaiyu Duan, for his great advices on research and life, as well as his kind support when I was drowning in depression. He is a great mentor not only for research but also for life. I would like to thank my committee members for asking questions. More specifically I would like to thank Professor Dinesh Loomba for showing me the local lifestyle and the fun problem. Dr. Sajad Abbar has also been very supportive during my research. He taught me several tricks for linear stability analysis, as well as numerical methods. I also want to thank Joshua Martin for the fun life of working in the office. We had many great discussions about physics, science fiction, movies, games, music, and everything else about this universe. I would like to give my special thanks to my wife Han Lu. She provided insights into life and minds that allows me to adapt to various situations in my PhD life.
   
   I can not provide a complete list of all the people that helped me. You should know that I have been blessed by everyone of you.
   
   Finally, as a member for People for Ethical Treatment of Computer, I would like to give my thanks to my Macbook Pro and the two servers, who has be extremely helpful for my research. Please be kind to me, if you wake up for nightmare of human labor.
