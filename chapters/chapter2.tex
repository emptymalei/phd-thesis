\chapter{\label{chap:basics}Neutrino Oscillations in Vacuum and in Smooth Matter Profiles}

Because the flavor eigenstates of the neutrino are not the same as its propagation eigenstates, it can change flavor while it propagates.
In this chapter, I will use the two-flavor scenario to explain some simple examples of neutrino oscillations\footnote{In most physical problems, two-neutrino-flavor scenario is a good approximation. The mass splits between the three mass eigenstates are so different that the corresponding oscillations occur on very diferent length scales. On the right length scale, the two-flavor scenario captures the significant features of the neutrino oscillations of the corresponding mass split.}.
I will first discuss neutrino oscillations in vacuum. After explaining the general principles of neutrino oscillations in matter, I will show how the solar neutrino problem can be solved by neutrino oscillations. Finally, I will demonstrate the flavor isospin picture which can be used to visualize neutrino oscillations.


\section{\label{chap:basics-sec:vacuum-oscillations}Vacuum Oscillations}

Before working out the math, I can estimate the frequency of the oscillations of the neutrino between its flavors. In the natural units, frequency has the same dimension as energy (see Appendix~\ref{chap:app-sec:conventions-subsec:units}). Consider an electron neutrino with moment $p$ which is a superposition of the two mass eigenstates $\ket{\nu_i}$ ($i=1,2$) with masses $m_i$ respectively. Since the neutrino masses are small, I can Taylor expand the energy of each mass eigenstate in terms of the corresponding mass:
\begin{align}
E_i^{(v)} & = \sqrt{m_i^2 + p^2 } \nonumber\\
& = p \sqrt{\frac{m_i^2}{p^2} + 1} \nonumber\\
& \approx p + \frac{1}{2} \frac{m_i^2}{p},
\label{chap:basics-section:neutrinos-eqn:energy-taylor}
\end{align}
The constant energy term in the above equation produces a global phase to the flavor wave function which does not affect neutrino flavor oscillations. The characteristic energy scale in the problem is the difference of energies between the two mass eigenstates,
\begin{equation}
    \omega_{\mathrm v} =  \frac{m_2^2-m_1^2}{2E} = \frac{\delta m^2}{2E},
    \label{chap:basics-section:neutrinos-eqn:qualitative-method-frequency}
\end{equation}
which turns out to be the vacuum oscillation frequency. Here $E=p$ is approximately the energy of the neutrino.

To work out the exact solutions, I will utilize the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. The wave function in flavor basis $\Psi^{(\ff)}$ is related to the wave function in mass basis $\Psi^{(\vv)}$ through a unitary mixing matrix $\mathsf U$,
\begin{equation}
\Psi^{(\mathrm f)} = \mathsf{U}\Psi^{(\vv)},
\label{chap:vacuum-eqn:wavefunction}
\end{equation}
where the upper indice ${}^{(v)}$ and ${}^{(f)}$ are used to denote the bases. The mixing matrix can be expressed using vacuum mixing angle $\theta_{\vv}$
\begin{equation}
\mathsf{U} = \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta_\vv & \sin \theta_\vv \\ -\sin \theta_\vv & \cos \theta_\vv \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
In vacuum mass basis, the neutrino has a free propagation Hamiltonian which is given by
\begin{equation}
\mathsf H^{(\vv)} = \begin{pmatrix} E_1 & 0 \\
0 & E_2
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
To the first order, the Hamiltonian becomes
\begin{align}
\mathsf H^{(\vv)} &= \frac{1}{2E} \begin{pmatrix}
m_1^2 & 0 \\
0 & m_2^2
\end{pmatrix} + E \mathsf{I} \nonumber \\
& =  \frac{1}{4E} \begin{pmatrix}
 - \delta m^2 & 0 \\
0 & \delta m^2
\end{pmatrix}  + \left(\frac{m_2^2 + m_1^2}{4E}  + E \right) \mathsf{I}.
\end{align}
Because a multiple of the identity matrix only gives an global phase to the neutrino flavor wave function, I will neglect it from now on:
\begin{equation}
\mathsf H^{(v)} =  \frac{\delta m^2}{4E} \begin{pmatrix}
-1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{pmatrix} = -\frac{\delta m^2}{4E} \sigma_3 = -\frac{\omega_{v}}{2}\sigma_3.
\end{equation}
The Schr\"{o}dinger equation has a simple solution in mass basis,
\begin{equation}
\Psi^{(v)}(t) = \begin{pmatrix}
c_1(0) e^{i \omega_v t/2 } \\
c_2(0) e^{ -i\omega_v t/2 }
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
% where the initial condition is
% \begin{equation}
% \Psi_v^{(v)}(0) = \begin{pmatrix}
% c_1(0) \\
% c_2(0)
% \end{pmatrix}.
% \end{equation}
Using Eqn.~\ref{chap:vacuum-eqn:wavefunction}, I obtain the wave function at anytime is related to wave function in mass basis,
\begin{align}
\Psi^{(f)}(t) &= \mathsf{U}\Psi^{(v)}(t) \\
& = \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta_v & \sin \theta_v \\ -\sin \theta_v & \cos \theta_v \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} c_1(0) e^{i\omega_v t/2 } \\
c_2(0) e^{ -i\omega_v t/2 }    \end{pmatrix} .
\label{chap:vacuum-eqn:wavefuncion-time}
\end{align}

Alternatively, I can also determine the Hamiltonian in flavor basis first, which is
%then solve the Sch\"{o}dinger equation. I will not show the steps here, however, the Hamiltonian in flavor basis is presented for future use,
\begin{equation}
\mathsf H^{(\ff)} = U H^{(\vv)} U^\dagger = -\frac{\omega_v}{2}\cos 2\theta_v \sigma_3 + \frac{\omega_v}{2} \sin 2\theta_v \sigma_1.
    \label{chap:basics-sec:vacuum-osc-eqn:hamiltonian-vacuum}
\end{equation}
By solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, I will obtain the same wave function as in Eqn.~\ref{chap:vacuum-eqn:wavefuncion-time}.

%In many astrophysical neutrino sources such as the solar core, electron neutrinos are the most abundant. Thus the initial condition is usually assumed to be electron flavor in the calculation which leads to the survival probability of electron flavor
The probability for an electron flavor neutrino at time $t$ is
\begin{equation}
P(\nu_e,t) = 1-\sin^2(2\theta_v)\sin^2\left( \frac{\omega_v t}{2} \right).
\end{equation}
Since the neutrino travels with approximately the speed of light, the electron neutrino survival probability at distance $L$ from the source is
\begin{equation}
P(\nu_e,L) =  1-\sin^2(2\theta_\vv)\sin^2\left( \frac{\omega_\vv}{2} L \right).
\end{equation}
An important parameter in vacuum oscillations is the oscillation length of the neutrino flavor conversion, $1/\omega_v$. This confirms our qualitative method result in Eqn.~\ref{chap:basics-section:neutrinos-eqn:qualitative-method-frequency}. I have plotted this result in Fig.~\ref{chap:basics-section:neutrinos-fig:vacuum-2-flavor-osc} which clearly shows the oscillatory behavior. The oscillation length is determined by the characteristic energy scale $\omega_v$, while the oscillation amplitude is determined by $\sin^2(2\theta_v)$.

\end{figure}


In nature, there are three neutrino flavors and, correspondingly, three neutrino mass eigenstates, which are shown in Fig.~\ref{chap:basics-sec:flavor-isospin-pic-fig:masses}. Because there are two different characteristic energy scales, $\omega_{v,21}=\delta m_{21}^2/2E$ and $\omega_{v,32}=\delta m_{31}^2/2E$, two oscillation periods should occur, as shown in Fig.~\ref{chap:basics-section:neutrinos-fig:vacuum-3-flavor-osc}. The fast oscillations are determined by the larger energy scale, $\omega_{v,32}$, while the slow oscillations are determined by the smaller one $\omega_{v,21}$. For the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy (with $m_3 < m_1 < m_2$), the oscillation frequencies are the same as in the normal mass hierarchy (with $m_3>m_2>m_1$) since they have the same characteristic energy scales. However, they will develop different phases in oscillations.

  }
    \label{chap:matter-fig:nc-cc}
\end{figure}

In many astrophysical environments, such as stars and core-collapse supernovae, neutrinos are mostly produced at the center of the object and propagate through the dense matter envelope. Although this matter envelope is essentially transparent to neutrinos, the refractive indices of the neutrinos in matter are different than those in vacuum.\footnote{The word ``matter" in this disseration refers to ordinary matter composed of electrons, positrons, nucleons and nuclei. We assume that the temperature and density of the environment are not high enough to produce muons and tau particles. We will discuss the effect of dense neutrino medium in Chapter~\ref{chap:collective}.} Because the neutral current weak interaction does not distinguish between neutrino flavors (see Fig.~\ref{chap:matter-fig:nc}), it has no impact on neutrino oscillations, and I will ignore it from now on. Meanwhile, the electrons and positrons in matter will cause electron flavor neutrinos to have refractive indices different than other neutrino flavors through the charge current weak interaction (see Fig.~\ref{chap:matter-fig:cc}).
% One of the significant matter effect on neutrino flavor oscillations is the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) effect~\cite{Mikheev:1986gs,wolf78,wolfensteinprd1979}, which is used to explain the deficit of electron flavor neutrino flux, as know as the solar neutrino problem~\cite{kuo1989,Petcov2002}. Later developments on the theories of matter effect revealed the parametric resonance of neutrino flavor oscillations due to fluctuations in matter density~\cite{Krastev1989,Akhmedov2000}, which is the neutrino analog of transitions between energy levels as a result of external optical stimulation. Parametric resonance is different from the MSW effect since it involves the parameters of the matter density, which is usually the period of matter density fluctuations. It has also be shown that neutrinos passing through the Earth can experience parametric resonance~\cite{Akhmedov1999, Petcov1998b}.
%Flavor conversion occurs as long as their propagation eigenstates are different from their flavor eigenstates. Since the neutral current interactions between the neutrinos and the matter is independent of the flavors, as shown in Fig.~\ref{chap:matter-fig:nc}, I only include the charged current interactions in the Hamiltonian, which is an effective potential for electron flavor.
This leads to an effective potential
\begin{equation}
\mathsf V^{(\ff)} = \frac{\sqrt{2}G_{\mathrm F} n_{\mathrm e} }{2}  \sigma_3,
\label{chap:basics-sec:oscillations-matter-eqn:effective-pot}
\end{equation}
where $G_{\mathrm F}$ is Fermi constant and $n_{\mathrm e}$ is net number density of the electrons. as usual, I have ignored the trace terms in the above equation.

The Hamiltonian with matter effect is the combination of Eqn.~\ref{chap:basics-sec:vacuum-osc-eqn:hamiltonian-vacuum} and Eqn.~\ref{chap:basics-sec:oscillations-matter-eqn:effective-pot}:
% \begin{equation}
% \mathsf H^{(\ff)} = \frac{ \omega_\vv }{2}\begin{pmatrix} -\cos 2\theta_\vv & \sin 2 \theta_\vv \\ \sin 2\theta_\vv & \cos 2\theta_\vv  \end{pmatrix},
% \end{equation}
% where we used the result of flavor basis vacuum oscillation Hamiltonian
% \begin{align}
% \mathsf H_\vv^{(\ff)}& = \mathsf{U} \mathsf H_\vv \mathsf{U}^\dagger \\
% &= \frac{ \omega_\vv }{2}\begin{pmatrix} -\cos 2\theta_\vv & \sin 2 \theta_\vv \\ \sin 2\theta_\vv & \cos 2\theta_\vv  \end{pmatrix}.
% \end{align}
\begin{equation}
\mathsf H_\mm^{(\ff)} = \left(\frac{\lambda}{2} -\frac{ \omega_\vv }{2} \cos 2\theta_\vv \right) {\sigma}_3  + \frac{ \omega_\vv }{2} \sin 2\theta_\vv {\sigma}_1,
\label{chap:basics-sec:msw-eqn:hamiltonian-matter-effect}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  \lambda = \sqrt{2}G_{\mathrm F} n_{\mathrm e}.
  \label{chap:basics-sec:oscillations-matter-eqn:lambda}
\end{equation}
Due to the off-diagonal terms in the Hamiltonian, the neutrino will experience oscillations in flavor. A resonance with the maximum flavor mixing occurs when the diagonal terms of $\mathsf H^{(\ff)}$ vanish,
\begin{equation}
\frac{\lambda}{2} -\frac{ \omega }{2} \cos 2\theta_\vv  = 0,
\end{equation}
which gives the Mikheyev--Smirnov--Wolfenstein (MSW) resonance condition.


\section{\label{chap:matter-sec:solar-neutrinos}Neutrino Oscillations in the Sun}


% \section{\label{chap:basics-sec:msw}Mikheyev--Smirnov--Wolfenstein Effect}

For the neutrinos produced in the Sun, they travel from the center of the Sun to the surface. The matter density is not uniform on the path of these solar neutrinos. The neutrino propagation eigenstates are different from flavor states in general~\cite{wolf78}. The importance of matter effect to our understanding of solar neutrinos is that it modifies the oscillation, depending on the matter density variation. For the Sun, the density change is not too dramatic. The neutrinos go through adiabatic evolution during the propagation, which means that the instantaneous eigenstates and eigenvectors of Hamiltonian is good enough for the time dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation.

For simplicity, we define the 'hatted' dimensionless matter potential using the vacuum oscillation frequency
\begin{align}
\hat\lambda & = \frac{\lambda}{\omega_\vv}.
\end{align}
The eigenstates, derived by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, are
\begin{align}
E_1 &= \frac{\omega_\vv}{2}\sqrt{ \hat\lambda +1 -  2\hat\lambda \cos 2\theta_\vv }\\
E_2 &= -\frac{\omega_\vv}{2}\sqrt{ \hat\lambda +1 -  2\hat\lambda \cos 2\theta_\vv }.
\end{align}


\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{chapters/assets/matter/mswEnergyLevels}
\caption{The two energy levels in matter effect. The potential has unit $\omega_\vv$. I have used $\sin^2\theta_\vv = 0.02 \approx \sin^2 \theta_{13}$.}
\label{fig:mswEnergyLevels}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:mswEnergyLevels} shows the two energy levels for a neutrino propagating in different matter potentials. For very high matter density, the electron flavor is almost comparable to heavy eigenstate. However, as the matter density becomes lower, the heavy propagation state will be gradually transformed to the other flavors. As the neutrinos reach the surface, the matter density is approaching vacuum. The heavy state of the neutrino is approaching electron flavor state. The resonance, which is the closest point of energy levels, happens at density $n_{\mathrm e} = 2\omega_\vv \cos(2\theta_\vv)/\sqrt{2}G_{\mathrm F}$ which depends on $\omega_\vv$. Resonances of neutrinos with different energies happens at different matter densities, which will significantly reshape the neutrino energy spectra. Even though only the electron flavor neutrinos are produced in the Sun, the neutrino flavor conversion to the other flavors is enhanced by the matter interactions, in addition to the vacuum oscillation. The exact neutrino flavor conversion is much more complicated than the MSW effect. As an approximation, the MSW transition is good enough for the solar neutrinos flavor oscillations~\cite{Lopes2013a}.

One of the interesting fact about MSW effect is the MSW triangle shown in Fig.~\ref{chap:basics-sec:msw-fig:msw-triangle}. The survival probability of the electron flavor neutrinos is plotted against $\log (\lambda/\omega_\vv)$ and $\log (\sin^2 2\theta_\vv)$. Qualitatively speaking, large conversion happens when matter density is not too small since a sufficient central potential is required for the level crossing. This leads to the triangle shape of the low survival probability region.

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{chapters/assets/basics/msw-triangle.png}

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{chapters/assets/basics/flavor-isospin-illus}
    \caption{In the flavor isospin picture, a flavor isospin pointing upward, i.e., along the third axis in flavor space, indicates that the neutrino is in the electron flavor, while the downward direction indicates the other flavor, such as the muon flavor.}
    \label{chap:basics-sec:flavor-isospin-pic-fig:flavor-isospin-illus}
\end{figure}

The oscillations in the two flavor scenario are consequences of the Hamiltonian in this two-level quantum system. It is known that two-level quantum systems can be visualized using the Bloch sphere. In the realm of neutrino physics, the neutrino flavor isospin was introduced for such purpose~\cite{Duan2006b}. The Hamiltonian for neutrino oscillations can be reformulated into a vector form.

Every two-by-two Hermitian matrix can be expanded in the quaternian basis. For example, the Hamiltonian for neutrino oscillations in vacuum can be written as
\begin{equation}
\mathsf H^{(\ff)} = - \frac{\vec{\sigma} }{2}\cdot {\vec{H}}^{(\ff)},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\sigma_1 =  \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}, \sigma_2 =  \begin{pmatrix}
0 & -\ii \\
\ii & 0
\end{pmatrix},  \sigma_3 =  \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & -1
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
are the three Pauli matrices. I will use $\vec{}$ to denote vectors in flavor space.
Meanwhile, the flavor quantum state of the neutrino is represented by the flavor isospin, which is defined as
\begin{equation}
    \vec s^{(\ff)} = {\Psi^{(\ff)}}^{\dagger} \frac{\vec{\sigma} }{2} \Psi^{(\ff)}.
\end{equation}
As shown in Fig.~\ref{chap:basics-sec:flavor-isospin-pic-fig:flavor-isospin-illus}, the directions of the flavor isospin in flavor space tell us the flavor content of the neutrino. A flavor isospin pointing upward in flavor space, i.e., along the direction of the third axis, denotes the electron flavor by definition. In the flavor isospin formalism, the electron flavor survival probability is
\begin{equation*}
P = \frac{1}{2} + s^{{(\ff)}}_3,
\label{chap:basics-sec:flavor-isospin-pic-eqn:probability-flavor}
\end{equation*}
where $s^{(\ff)}_3$ is the third component of the flavor isospin.
Correspondingly, the equation of motion for the flavor isospin describes its precession around the vector $\vec{H}^{(\ff)}$,
\begin{equation}
\dot{\vec{s}}^{(\ff)} = {\vec{s}}^{(\ff)} \times \vec{H}^{(\ff)}.
\label{chap:basics-sec:flavor-isospin-pic-eqn:eom-precession}
\end{equation}
This precession corresponds to periodic oscillations between the two neutrino flavors. For example, in vacuum oscillations, the Hamiltonian becomes
\begin{align*}
{\mathsf H}^{(f)} \to &\frac{\omega_{\mathrm v} }{2}\left( - \cos 2\theta_{\mathrm v } \sigma_3  + \sin 2\theta_{\mathrm{v}} \sigma_1 \right)
\to  \omega_\vv\begin{pmatrix}
 \sin \theta_\vv\\
0\\
\cos 2\theta_{\mathrm v}
\end{pmatrix},
\end{align*}
which is a vector of length $\omega_{\mathrm v}$ and tilted away from the third axis by the angle $2\theta_{\mathrm v}$.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \vspace*{-20pt}
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{chapters/assets/basics/flavor-isospin-vac-osc}
    \caption{Vacuum oscillations in the flavor isospin picture. The flavor isospin of a neutrino starting with the electron flavor will precess around the static ``Hamiltonian vector" $\vec H$, which gives periodic flavor oscillations according to Eqn.~\ref{chap:basics-sec:flavor-isospin-pic-eqn:probability-flavor}.}
    \label{chap:basics-sec:flavor-isospin-pic-fig:flavor-isospin-vac-osc}
\end{figure}

Eqn.~\ref{chap:basics-sec:flavor-isospin-pic-eqn:eom-precession} depicts the precession of the flavor isospin for a neutrino which starts with the electron flavor and propagates in vacuum. The oscillation frequency is trivially read out from Eqn.~\ref{chap:basics-sec:flavor-isospin-pic-eqn:eom-precession},
\begin{equation}
\omega_\vv = \lvert \vec{H}^{(\ff)} \rvert
\end{equation}





MSW effect is also easily explained using flavor isospin picture. The Hamiltonian in flavor isospin picture
\begin{align*}
    \mathsf H_\mm = & \frac{\omega_{\mathrm{v}}}{2}\left( - \cos 2\theta_{\mathrm{v}} {\sigma_3} + \sin 2\theta_{\mathrm{v}} {\sigma_1} \right)   + \frac{\lambda(x)}{2} {\sigma_3} \\
    \to &  \omega_{\mathrm v}\begin{pmatrix}
    - \sin 2\theta_{\mathrm v} \\
    0 \\
    \cos 2\theta_{\mathrm v}
    \end{pmatrix}   + \begin{pmatrix}
    0\\
    0\\
    - \lambda(x)
    \end{pmatrix}  \\
    = &  \vec H_{\mathrm v} + \vec H_{\mathrm m}(x),
\end{align*}
where $\vec H_{\mathrm v}$ is vacuum contribution and $\vec H_{\mathrm m}(x)$ is the matter potential contribution. The two vectors are visualized in Fig.~\ref{chap:basics-sec:flavor-isospin-pic-fig:matter-effect-notsolarge-density}. We discussed in Sec.~\ref{chap:basics-sec:msw} the adiabatic transitions of neutrino states in varying matter density. Fig.~\ref{chap:basics-sec:flavor-isospin-pic-fig:msw-adiabatic} shows the adiabatic evolution of neutrino flavor isospin. For region of high density matter background, which provides large matter potential, the total Hamiltonian is almost pointing downward. We observe almost no flavor oscillations since flavor isospin precession is tiny. As the neutrinos moving into smaller matter density regions, the flavor isospin is approximately following the evolution of Hamiltonian. Flavor conversion happens because of the evolution of Hamiltonian, even though flavor oscillations are still tiny. In the end, neutrinos reach the region with almost no matter, where they are almost converted to one of the mass eigenstates. In fact, those neutrinos won't oscillate that much in vacuum following this initial condition.

Neutrinos might experience a critical matter density, when the overall Hamiltonian is perpendicular to the upright axis. Assuming we have electron neutrinos going through such regions, they will experience maximum flavor oscillations, c.f.~Fig.~\ref{chap:basics-sec:flavor-isospin-pic-fig:msw-adiabatic-critical}.

\section{Summary}

Vacuum neutrino oscillations can be easily explained and calculated. However, it conveys the message of the nature of neutrino oscillations. Neutrinos are usually produced in flavor states through weak interactions. The neutrino does not remain in the same flavor state during its propagation because the flavor states are not the eigenstates of the propagation Hamiltonian. An extrapolation of this idea is that neutrinos might also oscillate in a uniform linear potential, the Hamiltonian of which would be similar to vacuum Hamiltonian but with different values. One of such situations is that neutrinos propagate through a region with a constant matter density, which I will explain in the next chapter.
