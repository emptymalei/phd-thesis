\label{introduction}

Neutrino has been one of the most astonishing particles in history. It's glorious history started with beta decay, which is the emission of electrons in nuclear decays,
\begin{equation*}
{}^{14}_{6} \mathrm C \to {}^{17}_{7}\mathrm N + \mathrm e^{-} + \bar\nu_{\mathrm e}.
\end{equation*}
The fact that electron energy spectrum in beta decay is continuous indicates the existence of a third product other than ${}^{17}_{7}\mathrm N$ and $\mathrm e^-$, which is proven to be anti-neutrinos. However, the direct detection of neutrinos was done two decades later, by Clyde Cowan and Frederick Reines in 1956 \cite{Cowan1956}. The Cowan-Reines experiment used nuclear reactor neutrinos as source. As the detection of neutrinos is feasible, Ray Davis and John Bahcall et al worked out the solar neutrino flux and lead the Homestake experiment to measure the solar neutrinos. The results lead to the well-known solar neutrino problem, that the neutrino flux detected was less than the prediction by solar models \cite{Bahcall1973}. It's know today that the solution to the problem is neutrino oscillations. Neutrino oscillations has been the hot topic and has been shown to be related to many other physics and astrophysics problems.

The interest in neutrino oscillations has been expanded to the field of core-collapse supernova explosions. Core-collapse supernova explodes when nuclear reactions fail to provide enough pressure to maintain current radius. During the collapse, the inner core is compressed to almost nuclear density, which provides a stiff equation of state. Materials in falling onto the core is bounced out and forming shock waves. Supernova simulations showed that the shock wave itself is not always energetic enough to trigger explosions for core-collapse supernovae \cite{Janka2016b}. To revive the shock, energy has to be deposited. The most prominent solution is to introduce reheating of the shock wave by neutrinos \cite{Janka2016b}.

To impose neutrino driven mechanism to computer simulations of supernova, the flux and flavor content of neutrinos has to be calculated. Thus neutrino oscillations in dense shock material and dense neutrino background is crucial to the problem.
