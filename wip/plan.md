## Plan of thesis

- [ ] Revise Abstract
- [ ] Add Conclusion


### Chapters

1. Background: neutrinos, related problems in astrophysics, some field theory
2. Neutrino Oscillations in general: vacuum oscillations
3. Neutrino oscillations in matter
4. Neutrino oscillations in dense neutrino background
5. Halo problem


### MSW Effect

I made many plots about MSW, such as MSW triangle and the ternary diagram. The ternary diagram is a good way to see that high matter density will suppress the small oscillations.

- [ ] Add the ternary diagram to MSW section.(Remake the plots in docs.neutrino.xyz)
- [ ] Add some survival probability plot of MSW effect to MSW section. (Remake the plots in docs.neutrino.xyz)
