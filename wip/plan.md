## Plan of thesis

- [ ] Add Conclusion Chapter


### Chapters

1. Background: neutrinos, related problems in astrophysics, some field theory
2. Neutrino Oscillations in vacuum
3. Neutrino Oscillations in matter
4. Collective Neutrino Oscillations: dispersion relation, halo problem
5. Conclusions and Outlook


### MSW Effect

I made many plots about MSW, such as MSW triangle and the ternary diagram. The ternary diagram is a good way to see that high matter density will suppress the small oscillations.

- [ ] Add the ternary diagram to MSW section.(Remake the plots in docs.neutrino.xyz)
- [ ] Add some survival probability plot of MSW effect to MSW section. (Remake the plots in docs.neutrino.xyz)
