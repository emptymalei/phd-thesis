@article{Janka2016b,
abstract = {Nonspherical mass motions are a generic feature of core-collapse supernovae, and hydrodynamic instabilities play a crucial role for the explosion mechanism. First successful neutrino-driven explosions could be obtained with self-consistent, first-principle simulations in three spatial dimensions (3D). But 3D models tend to be less prone to explosion than corresponding axisymmetric (2D) ones. This has been explained by 3D turbulence leading to energy cascading from large to small spatial scales, inversely to the 2D case, thus disfavoring the growth of buoyant plumes on the largest scales. Unless the inertia to explode simply reflects a lack of sufficient resolution in relevant regions, it suggests that some important aspect may still be missing for robust and sufficiently energetic neutrino-powered explosions. Such deficits could be associated with progenitor properties like rotation, magnetic fields or pre-collapse perturbations, or with microphysics that could lead to an enhancement of neutrino heating behind the shock. 3D simulations have also revealed new phenomena that are not present in 2D, for example spiral modes of the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) and a stunning dipolar lepton-emission self-sustained asymmetry (LESA). Both impose time- and direction-dependent variations on the detectable neutrino signal. The understanding of these effects and of their consequences is still in its infancy.},

@article{Fardon2004,
abstract = {We show that mass varying neutrinos (MaVaNs) can behave as a negative pressure fluid which could be the origin of the cosmic acceleration. We derive a model independent relation between the neutrino mass and the equation of state parameter of the neutrino dark energy, which is applicable for general theories of mass varying particles. The neutrino mass depends on the local neutrino density and the observed neutrino mass can exceed the cosmological bound on a constant neutrino mass. We discuss microscopic realizations of the MaVaN acceleration scenario, which involve a sterile neutrino. We consider naturalness constraints for mass varying particles, and find that both ev cutoffs and ev mass particles are needed to avoid fine-tuning. These considerations give a (current) mass of order an eV for the sterile neutrino in microscopic realizations, which could be detectable at MiniBooNE. Because the sterile neutrino was much heavier at earlier times, constraints from big bang nucleosynthesis on additional states are not problematic. We consider regions of high neutrino density and find that the most likely place today to find neutrino masses which are significantly different from the neutrino masses in our solar system is in a supernova. The possibility of different neutrino mass in different regions of the galaxy and the local group could be significant for Z-burst models of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. We also consider the cosmology of and the constraints on the ``acceleron'', the scalar field which is responsible for the varying neutrino mass, and briefly discuss neutrino density dependent variations in other constants, such as the fine structure constant.},

abstract = {After a short survey of the physics of solar neutrinos, giving an overview of hydrogen burning reactions, predictions of standard solar models and results of solar neutrino experiments, we discuss the solar-model-independent indications in favour of non-standard neutrino properties. The experimental results look to be in contradiction with each other, even disregarding some experiment: unless electron neutrinos disappear in their trip from the sun to the earth, the fluxes of intermediate energy neutrinos (those from 7Be electron capture and from the CNO cycle) result to be unphysically negative, or anyway extremely reduced with respect to standard solar model predictions. Next we review extensively non-standard solar models built as attempts to solve the solar neutrino puzzle. The dependence of the central solar temperature on chemical composition, opacity, age and on the values of the astrophysical S-factors for hydrogen-burning reactions is carefully investigated. Also, possible modifications of the branching among the various pp-chains in view of nuclear physics uncertainties are examined. Assuming standard neutrinos, all solar models examined fail in reconciling theory with experiments, even when the physical and chemical inputs are radically changed with respect to present knowledge and even if some of the experimental results are discarded.},

Three basic elements of the effect include: the refraction of neutrinos in matter, the resonance (level crossing) and the adiabaticity. The key notion is {\{}$\backslash$it the neutrino eigenstates{\}} in matter. Physical picture of the effect is described in terms of the flavors and the relative phases of eigenstates and the transitions between eigenstates. Features of the large mixing realization of the MSW effect are discussed. The large mixing MSW effect (LMA) provides the solution of the solar neutrino problem. We show in details how this mechanism works. Physics beyond the LMA solution is discussed. The lower {\$}Ar{\$}-production rate (in comparison with the LMA prediction) and absence of significant "turn up" of the spectrum at low energies can be due to an additional effect of the light sterile neutrino with very small mixing.},

@phdthesis{Keil2003,
abstract = {We study the flavor-dependent neutrino spectra formation in the core of a supernova (SN) by means of Monte Carlo simulations. A high-statistics neutrino signal from a galactic SN may contain information that severely constrains the parameter space for neutrino oscillations. Therefore, reliable predictions for flavor-dependent fluxes and spectra are urgently needed. In all traditional hydrodynamic simulations the nu{\_}mu,tau and nu{\_}mu,tau-bar interactions commonly included are rather schematic. With our Monte Carlo simulations we find that the most relevant sources for nu{\_}mu,tau and nu{\_}mu,tau-bar are traditionally not included. In comparing our numerical results for all flavors we find the standard hierarchy of mean energies nu{\_}e < nu{\_}e-bar < nu{\_}mu,tau, with, however, very similar values for nu{\_}mu,tau and nu{\_}e-bar. The luminosities of nu{\_}mu,tau and nu{\_}mu,tau-bar can differ by up to a factor of 2 from L{\_}nue-bar and L{\_}nue, the latter two are very similar. The Garching Group obtains similar results from their self-consistent simulation with the full set of interactions. These results are almost orthogonal to the previous standard picture of exactly equal luminosities of all flavors and differences in mean energies of up to a factor of 2. Existing concepts for identifying oscillation effects in a SN neutrino signal need to be revised. We present two methods for detecting the earth-matter effect that are rather independent of predictions from SN simulations.},

abstract = {We study the flavor evolution of a dense gas initially consisting of pure mono-energetic {\$}\backslashnu{\_}e{\$} and {\$}\backslashbar\backslashnu{\_}e{\$}. Using adiabatic invariants and the special symmetry in such a system we are able to calculate the flavor evolution of the neutrino gas for the cases with slowly decreasing neutrino number densities. These calculations give new insights into the results of recent large-scale numerical simulations of neutrino flavor transformation in supernovae. For example, our calculations reveal the existence of what we term the ``collective precession mode''. Our analyses suggest that neutrinos which travel on intersecting trajectories subject to destructive quantum interference nevertheless can be in this mode. This mode can result in sharp transitions in the final energy-dependent neutrino survival probabilities across all trajectories, a feature seen in the numerical simulations. Moreover, this transition is qualitatively different for the normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchies. Exploiting this difference, the neutrino signals from a future galactic supernova can potentially be used to determine the actual neutrino mass hierarchy.},

abstract = {It is shown that the strong enhancement of the Earth (day-night) effect for solar neutrinos crossing the Earth core in the case of the small mixing angle MSW electron neutrino to muon (tau) neutrino transition solution of the solar neutrino problem is due to a new resonance effect in the solar neutrino transitions in the Earth and not just to the MSW effect in the core. The effect is in many respects similar to the electron paramagnetic resonance. The conditions for existence of this new resonance effect are discussed. They include specific constraints on the neutrino oscillation lengths in the Earth mantle and in the Earth core, thus the resonance is a ``neutrino oscillation length resonance''. The effect exhibits strong dependence on the neutrino energy. Analytic expression for the probability accounting for the solar neutrino transitions in the Earth, which provides a high precision description of the transitions, including the new resonance effect, is derived. The implications of our results for the searches of the day-night asymmetry in the solar neutrino experiments are briefly discussed. The new resonance effect is operative also in the muon neutrino to electron neutrino (electron neutrino to muon neutrino) transitions of atmospheric neutrinos crossing the Earth core.},

@article{kuo1989,
abstract = {Review is devoted to the systematic representation of the theory (first part) and the applications (second part) of neutrino oscillations in matter. The evolution equations for mixed neutrinos in matter are deduced in different forms and analized. The consideration includes symmetries, limits of applications and some generalizations of equations. The analogies of the mixed neutrinos in matter have been found. We discuss in details the properties and the physical sense of the resonance in a system of mixed neutrinos. For homogeneous matter the effect of resonant enhancement of oscillations is described. Different representation of the adiabaticity condition, which determines a dynamics of neutrino oscillations, are given, and the adiabaticity parameter is introduced. Practically complete transformations of one neutrino species into another one are possible at the adiabatic (or near to adiabatic) crossing of resonance layer even at small vacuum mixing. The effect of non-oscillatory transition is remarked. Some results have been obtained for the adiabaticity violation regime. Also we review the exact solutions of the equations for special density distributions. The generalization of the theory for the case of three neutrino mixing is given. The effects of inelastic collisions as well as the divergence of neutrino wave packets are discussed. The theory of resonant conversion is applied then to the neutrino fluxes inside the Sun, the Earth and the collapsing stars. The distortion of the neutrino energy spectra by the matter filters with different density distributions are calculated. We describe the observable effects of conversion for solar and atmospheric neutrinos as well as for neutrinos from collapsing stars. The searching for these effects is considered as a method of measuring the neutrino masses and mixing. Resonant conversion may quite naturally solve the solar neutrino problem. The distinctions of resonance conversion effects and another mechanisms for solar $\nu$e - flux reduction are considered, and in this connection the possibilities of solar neutrino spectroscopy are outlined. We discuss the consequences of $\nu$ - signal detection from supernova 1987A. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

We demonstrate that the resulting turbulent density fluctuations may be directly observable in the neutrino signal starting at t{\textgreater}{\~{}} 3-4 s after the onset of the explosion. The effect comes from the modulation of the MSW flavor transformations by the turbulent density fluctuations. We derive a simple and general criterion for neutrino flavor depolarization in a Kolmogorov-type turbulence and apply it to the turbulence seen in modern numerical simulations.

@article{Kneller2010,
abstract = {Multidimensional core-collapse supernova simulations exhibit turbulence of large amplitude and over large scales. As neutrinos pass through the supernova mantle the turbulence is expected to modify their evolution compared to the case where the explosion is free of turbulence. In this paper we study this turbulence effect upon the neutrinos modeling the turbulence expected from multidimensional simulations by adding matter density fluctuations to density profiles taken from one-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. We investigate the impact upon the supernova neutrino transition probabilities as a function of the neutrino mixing angle $\theta$13 and turbulence amplitude. In the high resonant channel and with large $\theta$13 values we find that turbulence is effectively two flavor for fluctuation amplitudes 1{\%} and have identified a new effect due to the combination of turbulence and multiple high resonances that leads to a sensitivity to fluctuations amplitudes as small as ∼0.001{\%}. At small values of $\theta$13, beyond the range achievable in Earth based experiments, we find that turbulence leads to new flavor transient effects in the channel where the Mikheev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein high resonance occurs. Finally, we investigate large amplitude fluctuations which lead to three-flavor effects due to broken high-low factorization and significant nonresonant transitions and identify two nonresonant turbulence effects, one depending on the $\theta$13, and the other independent of this angle and due to the low Mikheev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein resonance. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Loreti1994,
abstract = {We develop the Redfield equation for delta-correlated gaussian noise and apply it to the case of two neutrino flavor or spin precession in the presence of a noisy matter density or magnetic field, respectively. The criteria under which physical fluctuations can be well approximated by the delta-correlated gaussian noise for the above cases are examined. Current limits on the possible neutrino magnetic moment and solar magnetic field suggest that a reasonably noisy solar magnetic field would not appreciably affect the solar electron neutrino flux. However, if the solar electron density has fluctuations of a few percent of the local density and a small enough correlation length, the MSW effect is suppressed for a range of parameters.},

The approximation adopted in this work is that of two level multiphoton on resonance. Utilizing achievable values of laser beam parameters, an enhanced production efficiency of up to 1011and 1015pairs can be obtained, for the two schemes respectively. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Izaguirre2016a,
abstract = {Collective pair conversion {\$}\backslashnu{\_}e\backslashbar\backslashnu{\_}e\backslashleftrightarrow \backslashnu{\_}{\{}x{\}}\backslashbar\backslashnu{\_}{\{}x{\}}{\$} by forward scattering, where {\$}x=\backslashmu{\$} or {\$}\backslashtau{\$}, may be generic for supernova neutrino transport. Depending on the local angular intensity of the electron lepton number carried by neutrinos, the conversion rate is "fast," i.e., of the order of {\$}\backslashsqrt{\{}2{\}}G{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\{}F{\}}{\}}(n{\_}{\{}\backslashnu{\_}e{\}}{\{}-{\}}\backslash,n{\_}{\{}\backslashbar\backslashnu{\_}e{\}})\backslashgg\backslashDelta m{\^{}}2{\_}{\{}\backslashrm atm{\}}/2E{\$}. We present a novel approach to understand these phenomena: A dispersion relation for the frequency and wave number {\$}(\backslashOmega,\backslashbf{\{}K{\}}){\$} of disturbances in the mean field of {\$}\backslashnu{\_}e\backslashnu{\_}x{\$} flavor coherence. Run-away solutions occur in "dispersion gaps," i.e., in "forbidden" intervals of {\$}\backslashOmega{\$} and/or {\$}\backslashbf{\{}K{\}}{\$} where propagating plane waves do not exist. We stress that the actual solutions also depend on the initial and/or boundary conditions which need to be further investigated.},
